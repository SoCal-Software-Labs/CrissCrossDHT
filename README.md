# CrissCrossDHT

This project was originally forked from [MlDHT](https://github.com/cit/MLDHT) and retains its original license.

It was overhauled exhaustively for the [CrissCross project](https://github.com/SoCal-Software-Labs/CrissCross).

It supports the following features:

* 256bit Multihash support
* Search
* Announce
* Store
* Lookup
* StoreName
* LookupName

Theoretically it could be used stand-alone, however there is currently no roadmap to making this friendly to use outside of CrissCross. You can find examples of how to use it in that project.
